## Description
This project demonstrates key data preprocessing techniques on a dataset containing information about countries, ages, salaries, and purchase status. The main tasks involve handling missing values, identifying and removing outliers, feature scaling, and splitting data into training and testing sets for machine learning models. Additionally, we visualize the effects of preprocessing using graphs and train a logistic regression model to predict purchase behavior.

## Inspiration
Data preprocessing is a critical step in every machine learning project. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate models and unreliable results. This project focuses on mastering the techniques of cleaning and preparing data, which form the foundation for any successful data science project.


#Source of Dataset
[Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alirezahasannejad/preprocessingdataset)
## Interesting Facts from Exploratory Data Analysis
- Missing Data: There were several missing values in the 'Age' and 'Salary' columns, which we handled using imputation.
- Outliers: Extreme salary values were identified as outliers and removed using Z-scores.
- Normalization: The 'Age' and 'Salary' features were successfully normalized, improving model performance.
- Categorical Variables: The 'Country' column was one-hot encoded, transforming categorical data into a numerical format.

## Technical Approach
1. Handling Missing Data: Imputed missing values in numeric columns using the mean.
2. Outlier Detection: Removed outliers based on Z-scores.
3. Feature Scaling: Normalized the data using MinMaxScaler.
4. One-Hot Encoding: Transformed categorical variables using get_dummies().
5. Train-Test Split: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test).
6. Model Training: Logistic Regression model was used for classification.
Evaluation: Confusion matrix was generated to evaluate model performance.

##  Original Development
The code for this project was developed using Python with popular data science libraries including:

- pandas for data manipulation
- seaborn and matplotlib for visualization
- scikit-learn for preprocessing and model training
###  Get Started
Pre-installation
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed and the necessary libraries by running the following command:
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
The requirements.txt file should include:

```bash 
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn
scipy
```
Set-up
clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-preprocessing-project.git
```
## Pre-installation
Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Results
After preprocessing and training the model:
- Accuracy: Achieved an accuracy of 85% on the test set.
- Confusion Matrix: Visualized to highlight correct and incorrect predictions for the "Purchased" outcome.


## Challenges
Handling Missing Data: Finding the best strategy to handle missing data without biasing the results.
Outliers: Determining appropriate thresholds for outlier detection and removal.
Normalization: Ensuring that normalization improves model performance rather than distorting the data..
